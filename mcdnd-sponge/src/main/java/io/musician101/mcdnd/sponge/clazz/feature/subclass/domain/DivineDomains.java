Some teach that knowledge is to be gathered and shared in libraries and universities, or promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention. Some deities hoard knowledge and keep its secrets to themselves. And some promise their followers that they will gain tremendous power if they unlock the secrets of the multiverse. Followers of these gods study esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret places of the earth, and learn all they can.

The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).").addToMap(1, Arrays.asList(LifeDomain.DOMAIN_SPELLS, LifeDomain.BONUS_PROFICIENCY, LifeDomain.DISCIPLE_OF_LIFE)).addToMap(2, Collections.singletonList(LifeDomain.PRESERVE_LIFE)).addToMap(6, Collections.singletonList(LifeDomain.BLESSED_HEALER)).addToMap(8, Collections.singletonList(LifeDomain.DIVINE_STRIKE)).addToMap(17, Collections.singletonList(LifeDomain.SUPREME_HEALING)).build();

Some of these gods are portrayed as the sun itself or as a charioteer who guides the sun across the sky. Others are tireless sentinels whose eyes pierce every shadow and see through every deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry, who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul's improvement. Clerics of a god of light are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their gods' discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.").addToMap(1, Arrays.asList(LightDomain.DOMAIN_SPELLS, LightDomain.BONUS_CANTRIP, LightDomain.WARDING_FLARE)).addToMap(2, Collections.singletonList(LightDomain.RADIANCE_OF_THE_DAWN)).addToMap(6, Collections.singletonList(LightDomain.IMPROVED_FLARE)).addToMap(8, Collections.singletonList(LightDomain.POTENT_SPELLCASTING)).addToMap(17, Collections.singletonList(LightDomain.CORONA_OF_LIGHT)).build();

Druids revere nature as a whole and might server one of these deities, practicing mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god.

In some pantheons, a god of this domain rules over other deities and is known for swift justice delivered by thunderbolts. In the pantheons of seafaring people, gods of this domain are ocean deities and the patrons of sailors.

They're patrons of thieves scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions.

The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and Kiri-Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumush, and Ares) and gods of conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet).
